# ButtonLib
ButtonLib is a small library used for adding clickable buttons to the screen. It allows the user to register buttons with custom string IDs, position them in a spot on the screen and has a priority stack.
Buttons can overlap on the screen and the highest priority is picked, allowing menus to be overlayed over one-another.
Buttons can also be registered to only respond to left/right clicks for more precise control.
