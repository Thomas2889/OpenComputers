# ProgramCore
This is a small library written just to make my style of programs easier to write. It just handles looping and calculating tick deltas in the background so that programs can be a little smaller and less cumbersome.

Documentation is in the [github wiki](https://github.com/Thomas2889/OpenComputers/wiki/ProgramCore)
